All too often I end up repeating procedures, or putting together useful knowledge from multiple disparate sources but never contribute back. This blog is my memory, my recognition for all the help I've ever received from other's blogs, and my thanks thereto. No longer shall my electons surf silently on the swells of cyberspace. Evictus, vicero.
